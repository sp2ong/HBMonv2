Requirements a webserver with activated PHP (apache, nginx or whatever) – PHP 7.x is ok


Extension of hbmonitor  – we log if a call is ended (I think it’s better as start) Please check permissions for wr
iting the logfile in target folder !


Call this script with crontab for everyday use.

Put this file in /etc/cron.daily/ and add attribute:

chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/lastheard



Call the website with http://YOUR_HOST/log.php it runs with a refresh/reload time of 30sec, change the script for 
other timeset.



Thank you, Heiko DL1BZ, who shared the lastheard code.
